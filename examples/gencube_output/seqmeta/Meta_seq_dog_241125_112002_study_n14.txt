SRP485653	GSE254079	PRJNA1068515	Genome-wide analyses reveals an association between invasive urothelial carcinoma in the Shetland sheepdog, NIPAL1, and the MAPK signaling pathway	Naturally occurring canine invasive urinary carcinoma (iUC) closely mimics human high grade iUC in terms of age of onset, pathology, cellular and molecular features, metastatic profiles, and treatment response . Shetland sheepdogs (Shelties), the focus of this study, are a small herding breed and popular family pet. Multiple studies demonstrate their extraordinary disease risk, with one survey reporting that of 3359 Shelties, iUC comprised 12% of all Sheltie cancer diagnoses, which is six times the expected rate of 2% for all dogs. In this study we analyze one hundred Shelties and 55 dogs from closely related breeds and identify a single major risk locus associated with iUC, featuring NIPA-like domain containing 1 (NIPAL1), a strong candidate gene, and associated mutations. By segregating samples according to genotype, we identify six additional loci that modify individual disease risk when combined with a putative pathogenic protein altering mutation in NIPAL1. Merging the GWAS loci with tumor sequence identifies the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway as a key component of canine iUC genetic susceptibility. Overall design: ChIP-Seq for 3 histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and K3K27ac in 2 canine invasive urinary carcinoma cell line samples.	Cells were harvested using a Cell Lifter in PBS, pelleted and lysed in three stages with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche #11873580001) at each step. DNA in pelleted nuclei was sheared on ice using a GEX130 Ultrasonic processor in 3 mL volumes at 30% output, 25s ON, then 60s OFF; repeated 8X. MagBead previously bound with antibody with histone modification washed with PBS, resuspended and added to fragmented DNA and incubated at 4C o/n. Beads with bound DNA strands were washed 5X, rinsed with PBS. Final rinse was aspirated and 115 uL of elution buffer was added and incubated at 65C for 15 minutes vortexing every 2 min followed by an o/n incubation on a Thermomixer R. Libraries were constructed using paired-end libraries with inserts averaging 320 bps and run on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 with 100 bp reads.

SRP438055	GSE232642	PRJNA973078	Altered Chromatin State Drives Hypersocial Behaviors in Canids	Polymorphic transposable elements found in regulatory sequences can impact the associated transactional modules. We investigated such molecular alterations for these elements in the dog genome that evolved from directional selection during domestication. We find that the polymorphic element in canine GTF2I intron 17 is associated with altered looping, and hence distinct cis-regulatory landscapes. We report supporting evidence of an E2F1-DNA binding peak concordant with the altered loop and higher expression of GTF2I exon 18. Additionally, we find altered looping with the canine LIMK1 gene and an increase in LAT2 expression within the loop. At a more global level, we discover differences in pathways regulating the extra-cellular matrix between samples of differential TE number. Our study emphasizes the role of chromatin architecture in social evolution. Overall design: Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K27ac and E2F1 in dog brainstem tissue of old males (12-16 years).	We extracted nuclei from flash frozen brainstem tissue using the Active Motif High sensitivity kit (Active Motif). Briefly, we re-suspended 50mg of flash-frozen tissue in Tissue fixation solution (4.35ml Molecular grade water, 0.5ml Active Motif 10x PBS, and 140ul 37% (v/v) formaldehyde). We rotated the tube for 8 minutes, added 51.5ul of Active Motif Stop Solution, and followed by 5 minutes of rotation. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using the Active Motif High sensitivity kit  complemented with the Active Motif Next Gen DNA library Prep kit and Active Motif Next Gen Indexing kit with 15 PCR cycles. 1 ng of DNA was used as starting material for input and ip samples. Post amplification libraries were size selected at 250-450bp in length using Agencourt AMPure XP beads from Beckman Coulter. Libraries were validated using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit.		vonHoldt Lab, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University	2024-05-16	18.0

SRP375418	GSE203104	PRJNA838586	Integrated mapping of the dog epigenome (ChIP-seq)	Dogs have become a valuable model in exploring multifaceted diseases and biology relevant to human health. Despite large-scale dog genome projects producing high-quality draft references, a comprehensive annotation of functional elements is still lacking. We addressed this through integrative next-generation sequencing of transcriptomes paired with five histone marks and DNA methylome profiling across 11 tissue types, deciphering the dog's epigenetic code by defining distinct chromatin states, super-enhancer and methylome landscapes, and thus showed that these regions are associated with a wide range of biological functions and cell/tissue identity. In addition, we confirmed that the phenotype-associated variants are enriched in tissue-specific regulatory regions and, therefore, the tissue of origin of the variants can be traced. Ultimately, we delineated conserved and dynamic epigenomic changes at the tissue- and species-specific resolutions. Our study provides an epigenomic blueprint of the dog that can be used for comparative biology and medical research. Overall design: 131 ChIP-seq (110 histone and 21 input data) generated from 11 adult normal tissue types of 3 beagles	The 11 frozen tissues were thawed on ice and 10 mg of tissue per IP reaction was chopped into ~1 mm3 pieces with two razor blades on the ice. Chopped tissues were washed out with PBS buffer containing Protease K, 10mM PMSF, and 10mM Sodium Butyrate histone deacetylase inhibitor to remove blood from the tissue. Washed tissue was grinded using pestle and mortar. Then prepared cell mass was cross-linked in the PBS buffer with 1.5% Formaldehyde added at room temperature(RT) for 20 minutes. By adding 125 mM Glycine and placing the samples on the rotator for 5 min, cross-linking reactions were stopped. Fixed cell mass was washed twice with PBS buffer containing Protease K, 10mM PMSF, and 10mM Sodium Butyrate.  Fixed cell mass was lysed using buffer A (5 mM PIPES buffer, 85 mM KCl, and 0.5% NP 40). The supernatant was centrifuged out and added to buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% SDS, and 2.5mM EDTA). All buffers contained Protease K, 10 mM PMSF, and 10 mM Sodium Butyrate histone deacetylase inhibitor. Sonication was then carried out to get 300-500 bp size fragments using Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode). Twenty to fifty cycles of 30 seconds, on and off, were performed at 4 ℃ depending on the tissue. Liver cells were sonicated for only 20 cycles. Chromatin solution was centrifuged to remove the debris and diluted with ChIP IP buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl, 0.05% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, and 167 mM NaCl). After adding 5 µg of sample to 10 µg of anti-H3K4me1 (ab8895), H3K27Ac (ab4729), H3K4me3 (ab8580), H3K27me3 (ab6002), H3K9me3 (ab8898), and IgG (Sc-2027) per IP reaction, the chromatin solution was incubated overnight at 4 ℃. The cross-linking was reversed and DNA was purified after treatment with protease K and RNase A. ChIPed DNA was quantified using the Qubit fluoro-spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the enrichment was validated by PCR. The ChIP library was prepared using the TruSeq ChIP Library Preparation Kit and sequenced in ~500 bp fragments using HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina) by Macrogen (Macrogen, Korea).

SRP346332	GSE188926	PRJNA780790	Canine DUXC isoforms and functional similarity to human DUX4 [ChIP-seq]	Human DUX4 and mouse Dux transcription factors are normally expressed in the germ line and early embryonic cells where they activate the cleavage stage genes. The misexpression of DUX4 in skeletal muscles causes Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). In primates and rodents, DUX4 and Dux arose from retrotransposition of the mRNA from the ancestral intron-containing DUXC, which is not found in these species, and whether it has similar roles in the cleavage stage and FSHD as DUX4 and Dux are unknown. Here, we identified two isoforms of DUXC in canine testis tissues: One encodes the canonical double homeodomain (DUXC) similar to DUX4/Dux, and one contains an extra exon that disrupts the conserved amino-acid sequence of the first homeodomain (DUXC-ALT). We expressed DUXC and DUXC-ALT in canine skeletal muscle and found that the expression of DUXC induced retrotransposons and pluripotent programs similar to DUX4 and Dux, whereas DUXC-ALT did not robustly activate genes in these assays. Overall design: We genereated ChIP-seq datasets of DUX4, DUXC, and DUXC-ALT expressed in cultured canine skeletal muscle and compared to negative control of Luciferase to identify the binding sites of these three transcription factors. The DUX4 and DUXC datasets were generated from  monoclonal cell lines; the DUXC-ALT from polycolnal and luceferase from both monoclonal and polyclonal cell liens.	Briefly, ~6x10e7 cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 11 minutes, quenched with glycine, lysed, and then sonicated to generate final DNA fragments of 150–600 bp. The soluble chromatin was diluted 1:10 and pre-cleared with protein A:G beads for 2 hours. Remaining chromatin was incubated with primary antibody overnight, then protein A:G beads were added for an additional 2 hours. Beads were washed and then de-crosslinked overnight. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's standard protocols.			2021-12-05	5.0

ERP021811		PRJEB19752	Methylome of 9 canine transmissible veneral tumour (CTVT) samples	The canine transmissible veneral tumour (CTVT) is one of the few known clonally transmissible cancers in nature. CTVT regresses spontaneously or after a single treatment with vincristine, however we know little of the mechanisms. To understand CTVT regression, we performed methylome analyses on serial biopsies of regressing and non-regressing CTVT, aiming to identify the likely drivers of CTVT regression.	Biopsies of were collected from dogs undergoing diagnostic assessment at the Department of Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Messina, Italy.  All the procedures on animals treated in Italy, including housing, conformed to EU regulations of animal welfare and are approved by the Italian Ministry of Health being in agreement with the directive D.P.C.M. of 28th February 2003. Qiagen AllPrep Micro kit according to the manufacturer's protocol Sonication with the Diagenode Bioruptor. Following fragmentation (180-230 bp fragments), library preparation consists of DNA end repair, 3′-dA tailing and adapter ligation. DNA was incubated with 150 ng anti-5-methylcytidine at 4°C for 15 hrs using automation and manufacturer reagents and protocols (Diagenode). Following immunoprecipitation, DNA was incubated with 1 μg proteinase K (Diagenode) at 55°C for 15 mins then 95°C for 15 mins. Each sample was subject to quality control using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with primers designed to amplify methylated/unmethylated control DNA (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22402632 for details). After confirming enrichment of methylated DNA in the immunoprecipitated fraction, DNA was purified using AmpureXT magnetic beads and amplified by 12 cycles adapter-mediated PCR. PCR products were purified using Ampure magnetic beads and run out on 2% low-melting point agarose gel. PCR fragments were excised and purified (QIAGEN). The resulting libraries (300–350 bp) were quality controlled using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with DNA1000 chips.		Department of Infection, UCL	2018-02-01	9.0	
ERP022397		PRJEB20256	Epigenomic changes associated with TGF-beta induced EMT in MDCK cells.	Our group is interested in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in particular, TGF-beta induced EMT. TGF-beta signalling has been shown to be an important factor in the induction of EMT and it has been demonstrated that adding TGF-beta to epithelial cells in culture is a convenient way to study the process of EMT. In response to TGF-beta, Smad2 and 3 are activated, and form complexes with Smad4, which then regulate transcription of target genes through interactions with other DNA binding transcription factors. In the induction of EMT, the activated Smads mediate transcriptional regulation through three families of transcription factors, resulting in repression of epithelial marker gene expression and activation of mesenchymal gene expression (Xu J, et al. 2009) <br></br> Also investigated in this study is the role of H2A.Z in EMT. H2A.Z is an evolutionary conserved and a metazoan essential histone variant of the H2A class. Mice deficient in H2A.Z die during early development but the reason for this is unknown (Faast et al. 2001). Previously, our laboratory showed that the loss of H2A.Z in Xenpous laevis impaired cell movement required for the formation of the mesoderm and neural crest (Ridgway et al. 2004). Given that mesoderm formation is critically dependent upon EMT, we therefore wondered whether H2A.Z might be a chromatin regulator of EMT. We transfected MDCK cells with a lentiviral vector to express a construct encoding an shRNA targeting canine H2A.Z as we wanted to test the hypothesis that H2A.Z is involved in the maintenance of cellular identity and that its loss might trigger de-differentiation. <br></br> In order to investigate changes in histone variant H2A.Z occupancy associated with TGF-beta induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) we performed H2A.Z ChIP-Seq in untreated and TGFb-treated MDCK cells. The MDCK cell line has been extensively used as a model system for EMT because they convert fully from the epithelial to the mesenchymal state in response to TGF-beta.  <br></br>Please note that RNA-seq data generated in conjunction to this ChIP-seq data set were also deposited at ArrayExpress under accession number E-MTAB-5628 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-5628 ).	MDCK cells were maintained in DMEM growth medium supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 40 min at 4,000g through an 8-ml sucrose cushion (1.2 M sucrose, 60 mM KCL, 15 mM HEPES, 15 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.6). The supernatant was carefully removed, and pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of micrococcal digestion buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 3 mM CaCl2) and passed five or six times through a size 29–gauge needle. The nuclear extract was digested for 35 min at 37 °C with micrococcal nuclease (New England Biolabs; 40 gel units per 330 μl of extract) to obtain ~80% mononucleosomes. After centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min, the supernatant (S1) and the resuspended pellet (S2) were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM EGTA overnight at 4 °C. The S1 and S2 supernatants were then combined and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 4% (v/v) glycerol, divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. For ChIP, 5 ug of anti- H2A.Z antibodies were used for 150 uq of MNAse digested chromatin.  Samples were then RNAse treated for 30 mins at 37 degrees followed by Proteinase K at 65 degrees for 5 hours to decrosslink and release DNA. Finally, AMPure beads were used to purify the ChIP/Input DNA. ChIP-Seq/MNase-Seq libraries were constructed using NEBnext Ultra DNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs).

SRP073903	GSE80662	PRJNA319621	Identification of TWIST1 transcriptional targets in the cranial mesoderm [ChIP-Seq]	TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is essential for the development of cranial mesoderm and cranial neural crest-derived craniofacial structures. Our previous work showed that, in the absence of TWIST1, some cells within the cranial mesoderm adopt an abnormal epithelial configuration. Here, we show by transcriptome analysis that loss of TWIST1 in the cranial mesoderm is accompanied by a reduction in the expression of genes that are associated with cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of cranial mesoderm-specific Twist1 loss-of-function mutant and control mouse embryos, we identified a set of genes that are both TWIST1-dependent and predominantly expressed in the mesoderm. By ChIP-seq in a cell line model of a TWIST1-dependent mesenchymal state, we identified, among the downstream genes, three direct transcriptional targets of TWIST1: Ddr2, Pcolce and Tgfbi.  Our findings show that the mesenchymal properties of the cranial mesoderm is likely to be regulated by a network of TWIST1 targets genes that influence the extracellular matrix and cell-matrix interactions, and collectively they are required for the morphogenesis of the craniofacial structures. Overall design: Chromatin extracts were subject to chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti TWIST1 monoclonal antibody (ChIP-seq). Input chromatin, not subject to ChIP was used as the negative control. Two independent replicate experiments were performed. Purified, immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced at Australian Genome Research facility.	Cells were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde/PBS (EM grade; ThermoScientific) for 10 minutes, quenched with glycine (0.25M) and washed in cold PBS. Frozen cells were thawed on ice and lysed in 1mL Lysis Buffer 1 (50mM HEPES-KOH pH8.0, 1mM EDTA, 140mM NaCl, 0.25%Triton X-100, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 10% glycerol) on ice for 10 min, dissociated by pipetting and pelleted by centrifugation at 800g for 5min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 1mL lysis buffer 3 (10mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine) and sonicated (Diagenode Bioruptor). Effective sonication was confirmed by Bioanalyzer analysis. An aliquot (10% of total volume?) was removed for use as the Input sample and the remaining extract was pre-cleared by incubation with 60μL protein A/G Dynabead magnetic beads (Dynal) for 3 hours. Beads for immunoprecipitation were blocked in 0.5% BSA, 0.5% Tween-20 in PBS overnight at 4°C. The cleared chromatin extract was incubated with an anti-TWIST1 monoclonal antibody (ChIP-grade Abcam) overnight at 4°C and the blocked beads added for 3 hours at 4°C. Beads were washed five times in RIPA buffer, twice in RIPA buffer containing 500mM NaCl , twice in LiCl washing buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 1mM EDTA, 250mM LiCl, 0.5% Igepal Ca-630, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate) and once in TE buffer.

SRP069246	GSE77543	PRJNA310756	Dynamics of NRSF/REST motif evolution favor the canonical NRSE/RE1 form	The transcription factor NRSF/REST represses many vertebrate neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by binding to 3 distinct motif classes, which are the canonical 21bp NRSEs, longer non-canonical sites and solo half-sites. We used ChIP-seq in four mammalian species to determine the evolution of the NRSF binding repertoire. We show that while some NRSEs are deeply conserved, genes with several NRSEs show evidence of compensatory site turnover, suggesting that the association of the transcription factor to its target gene is more important than the specific binding site. We also found that many newborn sites in human are associated with primate specific indels and transposable elements. Our analysis of sites with conserved ChIP-binding in all 4 species demonstrates that both the non-canonical and solo half-sites convert preferentially to canonical motifs. These findings support a model of dynamic conversion between different motif types that account for the preferential accumulation of the canonical NRSE during evolution. Overall design: Performed NRSF/REST ChIP-seq on mouse macrophages, dog myelomonocytic leukemia cells and horse skin fibroblasts. Each group with two IP replicates and one DNA input.	We cross-linked about 20 million cells with 1% formaldehyde for each replicate. Cross-linked chromatin was sonicated into 200-300bp fragments. DNA fragments were incubated with Dynabeads protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) bound by NRSF monoclonal antibody (Caltech Protein Expression Center, Pasadena, CA, USA, 12C11-1B11) overnight to perform immunoprecipitation. Then chromatin was reverse cross-linked to extract NRSF-bound DNA. DNA fragments recovered from ChIPs were end-repaired, ligated to adapters, size selected (200 to 300bp) and PCR-amplified to make the libraries for sequencing. The libraries were made based on Myers Lab protocol v042211 (http://myers.hudsonalpha.org/documents/Myers%20Lab%20ChIP-seq%20Protocol%20v042211.pdf).			2024-01-01	3.0
